# Flipping an image
## https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image

Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

```
Example 1:

Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

Example 2:

Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

Notes:
1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 20
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1
```
## Approach :
We will use the two pointer technique to reverse each row of the 2D matrix, and while reversing the rows, at the same time we will invert the 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's

### ðŸ’¥ XOR ðŸ’¥ - Inverting cell values
Since we are given that cell value can only be either 0 or 1.
We can use the XOR operation to invert the cell values.
If we do an XOR operation between cell value and **`1`**, we will get the inverted value as shown in table below.

### Implementation 

```java
public int[][] flipAndInvertImage(int[][] A) {
        if(A == null)
            return A;
        for(int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
            int start = 0;
            int end = A[0].length - 1;
            while(start < end){
                int temp = A[i][start];
                A[i][start] = A[i][end] ^ 1;
                A[i][end] = temp ^ 1;
                start++;
                end--;
            }
            
            if(start == end){
               A[i][start] = A[i][start] ^ 1 ;
            }   
        }
    return A;
}
```

Above implementation have runtime complexity of O(r * c) and space complexity of O(1), where r is the number of rows in the input matrix and c is the number of columns in the input matrix.

```
Runtime Complexity = O(r * c)
Space Complexity   = O(1)
```
